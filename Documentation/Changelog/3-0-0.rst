Breaking changes
----------------

Radio buttons variant removed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The option to use the partner rating with a radio selection (previous default) was obsolete and has been removed without replacement. I'm sorry about that.

The ability to switch between multiple selection with checkboxes and single selection via radio caused a few more complicated problems with regard to Extbase use. As this extension was developed on behalf of a customer who only uses the multiple selection variant, single selection has been discarded for the time being for budget reasons.

The display now behaves by default as it did in previous versions if the constant `plugin.tx_partnerrating_pi1.settings.allowMultipleReasons = 1` was defined.

If you want the single selection with radio buttons back feel free to contact the developer `Eric Harrer <mailto:info@eric-harrer.de>`__ and request this functionality for v13 in a paid way.
